    It's comforting. It reminds me so much of my childhood summers in Lithuania.A hot summer day meant that a cold slice of chocolate biscuit <p>
    cake would be so refreshing.Anyone can do it! You donâ€™t need an oven or a mixer or any equipment at all. Makes for a great lunchtime snack, <p>
    especially because you can cut it as small as you like.
