    It's comforting. It reminds me so much of my childhood summers in Lithuania.A hot summer day meant that a cold slice of chocolate biscuit <p>
    cake would be so refreshing.Anyone can do it! You donâ€™t need an oven or a mixer or any equipment at all. Makes for a great lunchtime snack, <p>
    especially because you can cut it as small as you like.

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>Servings: 10 slices</h5>
   <ul>
    <li>2 packs Marie biscuits (36 pieces), or digestive biscuits or graham crackers</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter, melted 100 g</li> 
    <li>6 tablespoon cocoa power</li>
    <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Break the biscuits into large chunks and set aside. If making the lazy cake in a loaf pan, lightly grease a 
            loaf pan and line with parchment paper. (Alternately, you can roll the lazy cake up in aluminum foil to make 
            a salami type shape)</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the melted butter, cocoa powder and condensed milk until smooth and combined. 
                Add the biscuit pieces and fold to combine.</li>
                <li>Place the biscuit and chocolate mixture into the prepared loaf pan and freeze for 2-3 hours until set. 
                    Or, place the mixture on a sheet of foil and squeeze into a log/cylindrical shape and freeze.</li>
                    <li>Once firm, slice and enjoy. Store any extra slices in the freezer and enjoy anytime!</li>
    </ol>
 </ul>
