   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>This sweet potato Mac and cheese is a variation of the classic Mac and cheese dish where sweet potato puree is added
        to the cheese sauce. <p>
        The sweet potato adds a hint of sweetness and a creamy texture to the sauce, making it a healthier and more nutritious
        version of the classic comfort food. <p>
        The dish is typically made by boiling and mashing sweet potatoes and adding them to a cheese sauce made with milk,
        butter, and shredded cheese. <p>
        The mixture is then combined with cooked pasta and baked until golden brown and bubbly. 
        It's a delicious and satisfying dish that's perfect for a cozy dinner or a family gathering.
